Hi, I am Yixiao He. I am from Hangzhou, China, which is a city famous for its history. I spent about 20 years in Hangzhou, and then I went to Brandeis University for my undergraduate study. Brandeis University is located in Waltham, MA. It is quite close to Boston, and a very quite and beautiful town. I have lived there for 3.5 years and then I went to Cornell University. 
I like to fishing, hiking and skiing.
